Project Euler
=============

These are my solutions to Project Euler. I will not be accepting 
pull requests, as this repository will remain my work. 
[The problem descriptions can be found here.](http://projecteuler.net/problems)

I will most likely not be finishing the entire problem set (few have). I will *not* be posting
the actual numeric solutions to each problem, but feel free to run the software yourself.

Most, if not all, of the project will be written in Python 3.3.
